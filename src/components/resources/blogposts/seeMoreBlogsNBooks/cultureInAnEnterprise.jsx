                                            <p>The culture with in the company plays a very important role to make an employee feel good about the work he / she is doing. Enterprises runs based on mission, vision and values it brings to the eco system we live in.</p>
                                            <blockquote><p>Enterprises must show the big picture to all employees and reiterate the same in every opportunity. I came across many organizations which does not tell the mission and vision of the company, even employees don't care in many places. This actually makes employees clue less when they are faced with choosing between two different options to take a decision. When you have two options while taking decision, your company values and vision helps you quantify which decision is better for the company.</p></blockquote>
                                            <p>Every employee in the organization should be aware of the why company was born in the first place. As a corporate, its important to explain the purpose of companies existence and how it impacts the eco system. Feel good factor is very important in the long run, the sense of satisfaction happens because you know that you are part of your company's mission which made an impact in the world we live in.</p>
                                            <p>As an employee we can wear multiple hats in a job, but as a company we cannot change missions once in six months. Roots of the company stays with the mission and vision and diversify our focus to peripheries of our core which gives us more value and long lasting impact..</p>
