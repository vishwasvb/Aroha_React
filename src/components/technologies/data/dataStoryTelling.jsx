As part of the modernization initiative for Cloud adoption and Digital Strategy, customer wanted to migrate the current application to cloud and create a scalable solution for reporting and visual analysis. By doing reverse engineering of 100 reports in the Cognos and 60 reports in BO, we came out with the consolidated reports and mapped the same with business users. Classified current assets into three categories which are heavy on tabular format, visual format and interactive mode. Worked with end users to club few reports into dashboards.  Successfully ran the two OLAP environments until end users are comfortable with new reports and dashboards. Challenge is to make sure the reconciliation between old reporting system and new reporting system.
